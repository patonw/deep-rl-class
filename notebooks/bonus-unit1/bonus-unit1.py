# ## Let's recap how this environment works
#
# ### The State Space: what Huggy "perceives."
#
# Huggy doesn't "see" his environment. Instead, we provide him information about the environment:
#
# - The target (stick) position
# - The relative position between himself and the target
# - The orientation of his legs.
#
# Given all this information, Huggy **can decide which action to take next to fulfill his goal**.
#
# <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/notebooks/unit-bonus1/huggy.jpg" alt="Huggy" width="100%">
#
#
# ### The Action Space: what moves Huggy can do
# <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/notebooks/unit-bonus1/huggy-action.jpg" alt="Huggy action" width="100%">
#
# **Joint motors drive huggy legs**. It means that to get the target, Huggy needs to **learn to rotate the joint motors of each of his legs correctly so he can move**.
#
# ### The Reward Function
#
# The reward function is designed so that **Huggy will fulfill his goal** : fetch the stick.
#
# Remember that one of the foundations of Reinforcement Learning is the *reward hypothesis*: a goal can be described as the **maximization of the expected cumulative reward**.
#
# Here, our goal is that Huggy **goes towards the stick but without spinning too much**. Hence, our reward function must translate this goal.
#
# Our reward function:
#
# <img src="https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface-deep-rl-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/notebooks/unit-bonus1/reward.jpg" alt="Huggy reward function" width="100%">
#
# - *Orientation bonus*: we **reward him for getting close to the target**.
# - *Time penalty*: a fixed-time penalty given at every action to **force him to get to the stick as fast as possible**.
# - *Rotation penalty*: we penalize Huggy if **he spins too much and turns too quickly**.
# - *Getting to the target reward*: we reward Huggy for **reaching the target**.

# %% [markdown] id="NAuEq32Mwvtz"
# ## Create the Huggy config file
#
# - In ML-Agents, you define the **training hyperparameters into config.yaml files.**
#
# - For the scope of this notebook, we're not going to modify the hyperparameters, but if you want to try as an experiment, you should also try to modify some other hyperparameters, Unity provides very [good documentation explaining each of them here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/main/docs/Training-Configuration-File.md).
#
# - But we need to create a config file for Huggy.
#
#   - To do that click on Folder logo on the left of your screen.

#   - Right mouse click and create a new file called `Huggy.yaml`

# - **In the case you want to modify the hyperparameters**, in Google Colab notebook, you can click here to open the config.yaml: `/content/ml-agents/config/ppo/Huggy.yaml`
#
# - For instance **if you want to save more models during the training** (for now, we save every 200,000 training timesteps). You need to modify:
#   - `checkpoint_interval`: The number of training timesteps collected between each checkpoint.
#   - `keep_checkpoints`: The maximum number of model checkpoints to keep.
#
# => Just keep in mind that **decreasing the `checkpoint_interval` means more models to upload to the Hub and so a longer uploading time**
# We‚Äôre now ready to train our agent üî•.

# ## Train our agent
#
# To train our agent, we just need to **launch mlagents-learn and select the executable containing the environment.**

#
# With ML Agents, we run a training script. We define four parameters:
#
# 1. `mlagents-learn <config>`: the path where the hyperparameter config file is.
# 2. `--env`: where the environment executable is.
# 3. `--run_id`: the name you want to give to your training run id.
# 4. `--no-graphics`: to not launch the visualization during the training.
#
# Train the model and use the `--resume` flag to continue training in case of interruption.
#
# > It will fail first time when you use `--resume`, try running the block again to bypass the error.
#
#

# %% [markdown] id="lN32oWF8zPjs"

# 3. `--repo-id`: the name of the Hugging Face repo you want to create or update. It‚Äôs always <your huggingface username>/<the repo name>
# If the repo does not exist **it will be created automatically**
# 4. `--commit-message`: since HF repos are git repository you need to define a commit message.

# Your model is pushed to the hub. You can view your model here: https://huggingface.co/ThomasSimonini/ppo-Huggy

# It‚Äôs the link to your model repository.

# 1. In step 1, choose your model repository which is the model id (in my case ThomasSimonini/ppo-Huggy).
#
# 2. In step 2, **choose what model you want to replay**:
#   - I have multiple ones, since we saved a model every 500000 timesteps.
#   - But since I want the more recent, I choose `Huggy.onnx`
